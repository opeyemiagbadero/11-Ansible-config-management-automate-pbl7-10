## Ansible – Automate Project 7 to 10 ##

I updated the name tag on the Jenkins EC2 Instance to Jenkins-Ansible, so as to run playbooks.

Created a new repository named ansible-config-mgt. on my github account

Configured Jenkins build job to save my repository content every time I changed it. Created a new freestyle project ansible in Jenkins and pointed it to my ‘ansible-config-mgt.’ repository.

Tested my setup by making some changes in README.MD file in the main branch and made sure that builds started automatically and Jenkins saved the files (build artifacts) in the  *ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/* folder.

Confirmed the change made in the README.md file by making sure that the builds starts automatically and jenkins saves the files i.e. build artifcats in the  *ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/* folder.

Installed git on the server and confirmed git was properly installed, initialized git and cloned down my ansible-config-mgt repo to my Jenkins-Ansible instance using the command  *git clone (https://github.com/opeyemiagbadero/11-Ansible-config-management-automate-pbl7-10.git)*

In my ansible-config-mgt GitHub repository, I created a new branch that was used for the development of a new feature. Gave the branch a descriptive and comprehensive name prj-11 and checked into the branch prj-11.

Created a directory and named it playbooks –  used to store all your playbook files, created another directory and named it inventory – used to keep the hosts organised. Within the playbooks folder, I created my first playbook, and named it common.yml. Within the inventory folder, I created an inventory file (.yml) for each environment (Development, Staging Testing and Production) dev, staging, uat, and prod respectively.

I updated git with the latest code and used the following git commands  *git status,  git add 'selected file'* and  *git commit -m "commit message"* commands to confirm the status, add, commit/push a branch into the github repository. I created a pull request, and used the hat of another developer as a reviewer and merged the code to the master branch.
