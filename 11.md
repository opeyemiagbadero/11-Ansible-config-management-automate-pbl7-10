## Ansible – Automate Project 7 to 10 ##

I updated the name tag on the Jenkins EC2 Instance to Jenkins-Ansible, so as to run playbooks.

Created a new repository named ansible-config-mgt. on my github account

Installed Ansible using the commands *sudo apt update* and *sudo apt install ansible*

Confirmed the Ansible version by running the command *ansible --version*

Configured Jenkins build job to save my repository content every time I changed it. Created a new freestyle project ansible in Jenkins and pointed it to my ‘ansible-config-mgt.’ repository.

Configured Webhook in GitHub and set webhook to trigger ansible build.

Configured a Post-build job to save all (**) files

Tested my setup by making some changes in README.MD file in the main branch and made sure that builds started automatically and Jenkins saved the files (build artifacts) in the  *ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/* folder.

Confirmed the change made in the README.md file by making sure that the builds starts automatically and jenkins saves the files i.e. build artifcats in the  *ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/* folder.

Opened VSC and configured it to connect to ansible config managmemt repository.

Installed git on the server and confirmed git was properly installed, initialized git and cloned down my ansible-config-mgt repo to my Jenkins-Ansible instance using the command  *git clone [<ansible-config-mgt repo (https://github.com/opeyemiagbadero/11-Ansible-config-management-automate-pbl7-10.git)*

In my ansible-config-mgt GitHub repository, I created a new branch that was used for the development of a new feature. Gave the branch a descriptive and comprehensive name prj-11 and checked into the branch prj-11.

Created a directory and named it playbooks –  used to store all your playbook files, create another directory and named it inventory – used to keep your hosts organised. Within the playbooks folder, I created my first playbook, and named it common.yml. Within the inventory folder, I created an inventory file (.yml) for each environment (Development, Staging Testing and Production) dev, staging, uat, and prod respectively.

I updated git with the latest code and used the following git commands  *git status,  git add 'selected file'* and  *git commit -m "commit message"* commands to confirm the status, add, commit/push a branch into the github repository. I created a pull request, and used the hat of another developer for a second, acted as a reviewer and merged the code to the master branch.
